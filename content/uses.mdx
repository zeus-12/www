## Raycast

Raycast is one of those apps I didn’t like at first.

I was already perfectly happy with Alfred. I mostly used it to search files or the occasional Google search. That was all I really expected from a Spotlight style app. It also annoyed me at first, the root search wouldn't search for files, so if i wanted to find a folder, it required multiple clicks which isn't the case w alfred. I’d uninstall it, would hear good things about it on Reddit, give it another shot, get annoyed again, & delete it. This cycle repeated a few times before it finally stuck.

What changed was spending time in the extension store.

Once I started exploring what the community had built, I realised Raycast is much more than just a launcher. Every time I noticed some small annoyance, there was either already an extension for it, or a clean way to build one myself.

You can tell a lot of care went into the details. For example, in the clipboard manager, pressing cmd<span className="text-[10px]">+</span>k shows extra actions like “Send to AI Chat” or “Save as snippet”. Small thing, but incredibly thoughtful.


Some things I use daily through Raycast:

- open projects directly in Cursor

- run bash scripts with keyboard shortcuts

- AI text workflows with diff and instant insert (was looking for a simple app just for this, turns out Raycast already does it, free, BYOK)

- caffeinate instead of amphetamine

- scheduling

- color picker

- search tabs across spaces in Arc

- snippets

- clipboard history

- emoji search that’s actually fast

- much better dictionary UX

- confetti

- notes that hide during screen sharing

- window management

- kill process

- search files

- much better version of Apple Shortcuts

- most apps I already used had a Raycast extension, and it’s super easy to work with

Most of these aren't big features on their own. But together, they save a lot of time, & is very well designed.
It took a while to grow on me. I bounced off it more than once. But once it clicked, it stuck.

Now it’s just part of how I use my Mac, & easily the first app I install on a new machine.
